# NotiMail üìß

**Version 0.12 is here, read the changelog for more information!**

**Development is ongoing, and the project is in the early alpha stage - things may break!**

Stay connected without the constant drain on your battery. Introducing **NotiMail** - the future of server-side email notifications supporting multiple push providers and multiple email accounts!

Mobile devices often use IMAP IDLE, maintaining a persistent connection to ensure real-time email notifications. Such continuous connections rapidly consume battery power. The modern era demanded a smarter, more energy-efficient solution. Meet NotiMail.

## Features üåü

- **Monitors Multiple Emails on the Server**: From version 0.9 onwards, NotiMail can monitor multiple email accounts. Ensure you never miss an email regardless of which account it's sent to.

- **Monitors Multiple Folders per Account**: With version 0.12, you can configure NotiMail to monitor multiple folders for each email account. Whether it's your 'inbox', 'junk', or any other folder, stay informed with NotiMail.

- **Processes and Notifies**: Once a new email is detected, NotiMail swiftly processes its details.

- **Leverages Multiple Push Providers for Alerts**: Rather than having your device always on alert, NotiMail sends notifications via multiple push providers, ensuring you're promptly informed.

- **Database Integration**: NotiMail uses an SQLite3 database to store and manage processed email UIDs, preventing repeated processing.

- **Built for Resilience**: With connectivity hiccups in mind, NotiMail ensures you're always the first to know.

- **Multiple And Different Push providers supported**: You can use one or more of the supported Push providers - all support authentication, which currently include ntfy, Gotify, and Pushover.

## Benefits üöÄ

-   **Extended Battery Life**: Experience a noticeable improvement in your device's battery lifespan.
    
-   **Swift Notifications**: Using one of the supported push providers, NotiMail provides real-time notifications without delay.
    
-   **Reduced Data Consumption**: With notifications being the primary data exchange, you can save on unnecessary data usage.
    
-   **Always in the Loop**: Whether it's a new email or a server glitch, NotiMail and push notifications guarantee you're always informed.
    

## Implementation Details üîß

-   **Efficient Operation**: Crafted for server-side operations, NotiMail guarantees a smooth, lightweight experience.
    
-   **Customizable Settings**: Through an intuitive `config.ini`, customize NotiMail to fit your needs. With the new 0.9 version, configure multiple email accounts for monitoring.
    
-   **Dependable Error Handling**: With robust mechanisms, NotiMail ensures you're notified of any hitches or anomalies.

## NotiMail Installation Walkthrough

----------

### Prerequisites:

Ensure you have Python installed on your machine. NotiMail is written in Python, and you'd need it to run the script. If you haven't already installed Python, download it from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/) or your OS package manager.

----------

### Step-by-Step Installation:

**1. Clone or Download NotiMail:**

If you've hosted `NotiMail` on a platform like GitHub, provide the link and the command. For this example, I'll use a placeholder link:

bash

`git clone https://github.com/draga79/NotiMail.git` 

If you're not using version control, ensure users have a link to download the `.zip` or `.tar.gz` of the project and then extract it.

**2. Navigate to the NotiMail Directory:**

bash

`cd NotiMail` 

**3. Set Up a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended):**

A virtual environment ensures that the dependencies for the project don't interfere with your other Python projects or system libraries.

bash

`python -m venv notimail-env` 

Activate the virtual environment:

-   On macOS and Linux:
    
    bash
    

-   `source notimail-env/bin/activate` 
    
-   On Windows:
    
    bash
    

-   `.\notimail-env\Scripts\activate` 
    

**4. Install the Required Libraries:**

Install the necessary Python libraries using `pip`, for example:

bash

`pip install requests` 

**5. Configure NotiMail:**

Open the `config.ini` file in a text editor. From version 0.9, you can configure multiple email accounts for monitoring by adding sections like `[EMAIL:account1]`, `[EMAIL:account2]`, etc. If you're upgrading from an earlier version, your old single `[EMAIL]` configuration is still supported. Also, update the configuration for one (or more) of the supported push providers.

**6. Run NotiMail:**

bash

`python NotiMail.py` 

----------

### Troubleshooting:

1.  **Python Not Found**: Ensure Python is installed and added to your system's PATH.
    
3.  **Dependencies Missing**: If the script raises an error about missing modules, ensure you've activated your virtual environment and installed all necessary libraries.
    

----------

With that, you should have NotiMail up and running on your system! Enjoy a more efficient email notification experience.

## Changelog

### Version 0.12

#### New Features:

- **Multiple Folder Monitoring**: From this version onwards, NotiMail supports monitoring multiple folders for each configured email account. This allows users to, for example, monitor both the 'inbox' and 'junk' folders simultaneously. Each folder is treated as a separate connection, ensuring robust and comprehensive monitoring.
- **Configuration Validation**: Introduced command-line functions to validate the config.ini file. This ensures that your settings are correctly configured before you start the NotiMail service.
- **Notification Provider Testing**: You can now test the notification providers by sending a test notification to verify their correct setup and functioning.
- **IMAP Folder Listing**: Added a feature to list all IMAP folders of the configured mailboxes, providing better insights and facilitating precise folder monitoring.
  
#### Changes:

- **Configuration (`config.ini`)**: Introduced the ability to specify multiple folders for each email account using the `Folders` configuration key. If not specified, it defaults to the 'inbox' folder.
- **Logging Enhancements**: All logging and print statements now include the folder name, providing a clearer understanding of ongoing operations per folder.
- **Codebase**: Enhanced error handling, and improved logging to provide clearer insights into the application's operations.

### Version 0.11

#### New Features:

- Command-Line Flexibility: Now you can customize your config file path using -c or --config flags. The default remains 'config.ini'.
- Man Page: Introduced a man page for NotiMail, making it easier for users to understand usage and options.
- Dynamic Database Location: Configure your database path in the settings, allowing for more flexible deployments.

#### Changes:

- **Codebase:**
  - Introduced `argparse` to enable command-line arguments. You can now specify the path to a configuration file using the `-c` or `--config` option.
  - Moved the configuration reading to the top of the script to make it globally accessible.
  - Updated the logging setup to use the log file location from the config file (`LogFileLocation`). If not set, it defaults to `notimail.log`.
  - Modified the `DatabaseHandler` class to use the database location from the config file (`DataBaseLocation`). If not set, it defaults to `processed_emails.db`.
  - Improved Logging: Logs now include thread names, providing clearer insights into operations.
  - Stability Upgrades: Enhanced handling of 'BYE' responses from servers. Plus, in case of connection loss, the tool will now auto-retry to maintain smooth operations.
  - Socket Timeout: Adjusted the default socket timeout setting to further optimize responsiveness.
- **Configuration (`config.ini`):**
  - Introduced a new `[GENERAL]` section. You can specify `LogFileLocation` and `DataBaseLocation` within this section to set the desired paths for the log file and database, respectively.

### Version 0.10

- Authentication Tokens for NTFY Notifications: Enhanced the NTFYNotificationProvider to support optional authentication tokens. If a token is provided in the `config.ini` file for a specific NTFY URL, the notification request will include an "Authorization" header for authentication.

### Version 0.9

- Introduced support for monitoring multiple email accounts. Configure multiple accounts in the `config.ini` using the format `[EMAIL:account1]`, `[EMAIL:account2]`, and so on.
- Maintained compatibility with the old single `[EMAIL]` configuration for a smooth upgrade path.
